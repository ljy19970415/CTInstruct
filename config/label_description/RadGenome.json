{
    "medical material": "Foreign objects intentionally placed in the body for therapeutic purposes (e.g., surgical clips, pacemakers, catheters, orthopedic hardware). Visible on imaging as artificial structures.",
    "arterial wall calcification": "Pathological deposition of calcium salts in arterial walls. Associated with atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk.",
    "cardiomegaly": "Abnormal enlargement of the heart volume, commonly measured by cardiothoracic ratio >0.5 on chest X-ray. Causes include hypertension, valvular disease, and cardiomyopathy.",
    "pericardial effusion": "Abnormal fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. May cause cardiac tamponade if large.",
    "coronary artery wall calcification": "Calcium deposition in coronary arteries visualized on CT. Quantified by Agatston score for coronary artery disease risk assessment.",
    "hiatal hernia": "Protrusion of abdominal structures (typically stomach fundus) through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity.",
    "lymphadenopathy": "Abnormal lymph node enlargement (>1cm short axis). Categorized as reactive, infectious, or malignant based on size, shape and distribution.",
    "emphysema": "Permanent destruction of alveolar walls and terminal airspace enlargement. Key component of COPD, characterized by decreased lung attenuation on CT.",
    "atelectasis": "Partial or complete collapse of lung tissue due to airway obstruction, compression, or surfactant deficiency. Causes reduced lung volume and air bronchogram absence.",
    "lung nodule": "Discrete pulmonary opacity ≤3cm in diameter. Requires monitoring for malignant features (spiculation, growth) versus benign causes.",
    "lung opacity": "Nonspecific term for any region of increased lung attenuation on imaging. Includes ground-glass opacity and consolidation patterns.",
    "pulmonary fibrotic sequela": "Post-inflammatory scarring with fibroblast proliferation causing irreversible architectural distortion and reticulation.",
    "pleural effusion": "Abnormal fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity. Classified as transudate or exudate based on Light's criteria.",
    "mosaic attenuation pattern": "Heterogeneous lung attenuation on CT with alternating regions of normal and decreased density. Indicates small airway disease or vascular pathology.",
    "peribronchial thickening": "Increased bronchial wall thickness (>1-2mm) due to inflammation, edema or fibrosis. Common in asthma and chronic bronchitis.",
    "consolidation": "Replacement of alveolar air by fluid, cells or tissue. Manifests as homogeneous lung opacification with air bronchograms.",
    "bronchiectasis": "Irreversible bronchial dilation with wall thickening. Classified as cylindrical, varicose or cystic. Causes chronic cough and recurrent infections.",
    "interlobular septal thickening": "Thickening of fibrous septa separating secondary pulmonary lobules. Appears as linear opacities perpendicular to pleura on CT."
